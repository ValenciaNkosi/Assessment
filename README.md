## Assessment

Use the files contained within this directory to configure a basic Bootstrap / Gulp project. 
The idea is to make use of this 'boilerplate' project to create a Bootstrap themed web-page.

To kick start the project by running

```
npm install
```

#### Brief - to test the candidates understanding of Gulp and Bootstrap. 
Create a Discovery themed web page, by making use of the files contained within this directory. 
We recommend using the Discovery website as your reference point.


#### Notes

Run "gulp" to fire up browser-sync

Handlesbars task throws an error, I couldn't resolve it in time. I left it there to show that I had intentions of doing some HTML templating
